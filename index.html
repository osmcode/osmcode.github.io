    <div class="subtitle">Open Source Software for Working with OpenStreetMap Data</div>
</div>

<p>The <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/" class="extlink">OpenStreetMap
project</a> has collected a huge amount of data about our planet. All this data
is freely available to everybody. The tools on this site help you work with
that data in many different ways. They are intended for developers and
cartographers who want to use OSM data in their own projects.</p>

<p style="color: red;">These tools are meant for OSM data, not for other kinds
of data that comes in something resembling the OSM data formats. If they don't
work with non-OSM data, this is not considered a bug. Please don't open a bug
report unless you are willing to pay money to the developers to fix these
problems for you.</p>

            such as reading and writing OSM files, or assembling areas from
            multipolygon relations.
