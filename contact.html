    <h2>Getting Help</h2>

    <p style="border: 1px solid #f08080; border-radius: 4px; padding: 4px;">When
    you ask for help, describe exactly what you did (including what commands,
    config files, input data, etc. you used), what you expected what would
    happen, and what happened instead (including log files, output files, etc.).
    Include the version of the operating system and all relevant software, etc.
    in your report.</p>

    <p><b>community.openstreetmap.org:</b> You can ask questions on <a
    href="https://community.openstreetmap.org/">community.openstreetmap.org</a>.</p>

    <p><b>Mailing List:</b> The <a
    href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/dev">OSM developer list</a>
    is a good place to get into contact with Osmium developers and users. It is
    very likely that somebody can help you there.</p>

    <p><b>IRC:</b> Sometimes you just have a quick question and need a quick
    answer. The IRC chat is perfect for that. Come to the #osm-dev channel on
    the OFTC net. (See <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Irc">the
    OSM wiki</a> for some more information on how to get there.) The best way
    to get an answer is to just ask your question, short and specific is better
    than long-winded. If somebody is there who can help, they usually will.</p>

    <h2>Reporting Bugs</h2>

    <p>Please report bugs through the Github issue system in the appropriate
    repository for the software or project you are using.</p>

    <p>This website is maintained in <a
    href="https://github.com/osmcode/osmcode.github.io">a git repository</a>,
    too. Please report problems with the website there.</p>

    <h2>Commercial Support</h2>

    <p>The free support through the community works usually very well, but if you
    have some special needs, you can get commercial support from the Osmium
    maintainer, <a href="https://www.jochentopf.com/">Jochen Topf</a>.</p>
