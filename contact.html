    <h2>Getting Help</h2>

    <p style="border: 1px solid #f08080; border-radius: 4px; padding: 4px;">When
    you ask for help, describe exactly what you did (including what commands,
    config files, input data, etc. you used), what you expected what would
    happen, and what happened instead (including log files, output files, etc.).
    Include the version of the operating system and all relevant software, etc.
    in your report.</p>

    <p><b>help.openstreetmap.org:</b> You can ask questions on <a
    href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/">help.openstreetmap.org</a>.
    Please have a look around whether your question was answered already.
    Many have been tagged with
    <a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/tags/osmium/">osmium</a> or
    <a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/tags/pyosmium/">pyosmium</a>.</p>

    <p><b>Mailing List:</b> The <a
    href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/dev">OSM developer list</a>
    is a good place to get into contact with Osmium developers and users. It is
    very likely that somebody can help you there.</p>

    <p><b>IRC:</b> Sometimes you just have a quick question and need a quick
    answer. The IRC chat is perfect for that. Come to the #osm-dev channel on
    the OFTC net. (See <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Irc">the
    OSM wiki</a> for some more information on how to get there.) The best way
    to get an answer is to just ask your question, short and specific is better
    than long-winded. If somebody is there who can help, they usually will.</p>
