<p>The tools on osmcode.org are build by members of the OpenStreetMap and Open

    <h2>Where to find us?</h2>

    <p><b>Mailing List:</b> The <a
    href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/dev">OSM developer list</a>
    is a good place to get into contact with Osmium developers and users. It is
    very likely that somebody can help you there.</p>

    <p><b>IRC:</b> Sometimes you just have a quick question and need a quick
    answer. The IRC chat is perfect for that. Come to the #osm-dev channel on
    the OFTC net. (See <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Irc">the
    OSM wiki</a> for some more information on how to get there.) The best way
    to get an answer is to just ask your question, short and specific is better
    than long-winded. If somebody is there who can help, they usually will.</p>

    <h2>Reporting Bugs</h2>

    <p>Please report bugs through the Github issue system in the appropriate
    repository for the software or project you are using.</p>

    <p>This website is maintained in <a
    href="https://github.com/osmcode/osmcode.github.io">a git repository</a>,
    too. Please report problems with the website there.</p>

    <h2>Commercial Support</h2>

    <p>The free support through the community works usually very well, but if you
    have some special needs, you can get commercial support from the Osmium
    maintainer, <a href="https://www.jochentopf.com/">Jochen Topf</a>.</p>
